<p class="heading">Welcome to Travel Mapping</p>

<p class="text">

Travel Mapping is a collaborative project implemented and maintained
by a <a href="credits.php#contributors">group</a> of travel
enthusiasts who enjoy tracking their cumulative travels.  This site
allows its <a href="/user">users</a> to submit lists of highway
segments they've traveled on the <a href="/hb">highway
systems</a> that have been included in the project.  Those lists are
then imported into the project's database, to be included along with
other users' stats and maps.

</p>

<p class="heading">How to Participate</p>

<p class="text">

Anyone can submit their travels to be included in the site.  Please
see the information in <a href="/forum">the project forum</a> for how
to create and submit your data.
